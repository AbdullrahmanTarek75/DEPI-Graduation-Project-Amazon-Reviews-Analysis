# DEPI Graduation Project: Amazon Reviews Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Amazon reviews using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We leverage Hugging Face models for sentiment analysis and MLOps practices to streamline the development and deployment process. The project is deployed on Azure, and an interactive interface is built using Streamlit for real-time insights.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze customer reviews and predict sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) using pre-trained models from Hugging Face.
- **MLOps with MLflow**: Implement end-to-end MLOps practices, including model tracking, version control, and experiment logging using MLflow.
- **Deployment on Azure**: Scalable deployment of the project on Azure cloud platform.
- **Interactive UI**: Real-time visualization and interaction with the analysis using Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- **NLP Framework**: Hugging Face Transformers
- **MLOps**: MLflow
- **Cloud Platform**: Azure
- **Web Interface**: Streamlit
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, scikit-learn, transformers, matplotlib, seaborn
  
## Dataset

The model is trained on the [Amazon Product Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arhamrumi/amazon-product-reviews) dataset from Kaggle.
